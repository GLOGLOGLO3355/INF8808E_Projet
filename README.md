# Final Release – INF8808E – Summer 2025
This site is an interactive data visualization platform designed to explore the factors influencing students academic performance.

# Project Objective
The goal is to understand how personal habits, school conditions, and family background influence student grades, through interactive visualizations accessible to various audiences:

- Students seeking to adjust their study habits

- Parents interested in understanding their impact on academic success

- Educational organizations looking to support informed decision-making

# Dataset
The dataset (6607 entries, 20 variables) is a realistically simulated collection of student scenarios, including:

- Study hours, sleep duration, motivation level

- Parental support, family income, school type

- Extracurricular activities, peer influence, learning disabilities

- Previous and current exam scores

# What the Demo Site Shows
The site features several visualizations built with Plotly Dash. These aim to answer key questions such as:

- The impact of tutoring and study time on performance

- The relationship between parental involvement and access to resources

- The influence of sleep and motivation on attendance

- Educational disparities based on income and school type
